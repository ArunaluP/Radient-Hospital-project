Patient Follow-Up System
This project is a web-based patient follow-up system designed to streamline communication and tracking of patient care plans. It allows doctors to create follow-up tasks for specific patients and assign them to responsible staff members. The system automatically sends reminders to ensure the patient care cycle continues until the patient has fully recovered.
